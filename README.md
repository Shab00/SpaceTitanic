# Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting the survival rate of passengers on the spaceship Titanic using machine learning techniques. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`sTdata.ipynb`).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the spaceship Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other relevant attributes.

## Code Explanation

The provided code is part of a Jupyter Notebook (`sTdata.ipynb`) that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing information about the passengers.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the machine learning model.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
